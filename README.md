# Poker3 Keyboard Layout

## Description  
- We use [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/) to create a Productive Keyboard Layout.   
- This layout allows you to keep your hands on home rows all the time. Hence it increases your productivity.   
- This layout works by using CapsLock as the modifier key, and then we bind it with other keys to trigger many most used keys such as Arrow keys, Delete, Backspace, etc.  

## System Requirements
- Windows Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10 Only. We don't support MacOS at the moment. 

## Installation
- Download the "Poker3Layout.exe" file.
- Double Click on it.
- You will see a green icon on your taskbar with letter "H" in it.
- Done. You are ready to use it.

3. To Activate Capslock. Hold down *Capslock* and Press *Enter* (Red color). 

4. Copy and Paste with Mouse:

    - Eg: `Hold Down *Alt* and *Left-Click* will Copy the select content.`

**Note: These keys can bind to more key.**  
- Eg: `Caps + Shift + j` =  select while moving to the left.


## Known Issues With Software

  - Hold Spacebar to move image around won't work. Please use the photoshop version under __feature/photoshop-version-1.0__ instead.
    - Note: You will lose the `Caps + Space = BackSpace` feature.
